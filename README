CKAN API PHP Client

Loads of External libraries are required to use the CKAN client.  This software uses composer http://getcomposer.org/ to install and manage dependencies.

1) Composer is required to install all the dependencies.  To install composer, you need to run:
	curl http://getcomposer.org/installer | php 
	in the root of the project.
	You may get an error saying that you need to disable detect_unicode to install composer.  If this happens, add
	detect_unicode=off to your php.ini

2) To install the project dependencies, you should run:
	php composer.phar install
	in the root of the project.

3) CKAN PHP client uses a PSR-0 compliant autoloader (supplied by composer). In order to use the library, you should require vendor/autoload.php or use your own PSR-0 compliant autoloader.

To run the acceptance tests from the command line run:

bin/behat 

To run the unit tests from the command line run:

bin/phpunit
